## Quick start

You must have an [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](http://aws.amazon.com/) account.

The code consists of Terraform examples using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) on AWS (Amazon Web Services).

All the code is in the [code](/AWS Cloud Fundamentals) folder.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder.

This is the list of examples:

* [01-hello-world](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/01-launch-ec2-instance) - Terraform "Hello, World": Example of how to deploy a single server on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using the shortest script.
* [02-one-server](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/02-create-ebs-volume) - Terraform One Server: Example of how deploy a single server on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* [03-one-webserver](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/03-module-vpc) - Terraform Web Server: Example of how deploy a single web server on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The web server returns "Hello, World" for the URL `/` listening on port 8080.
* [04-one-webserver-with-vars](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/04-basic-lambda-function) - Terraform Web Server with vars: Example of how deploy a single web server on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The web server returns "Hello, World" for the URL `/` listening on port 8080, which is defined as a variable.
* [05-cluster-webserver](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/05-create-lambda-function-with-S3bucket) - Terraform Cluster Web Server: Example of how deploy a cluster of web servers on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using EC2 and Auto Scaling, as well as a load balancer using ELB. The cluster of web servers returns "Hello, World" for the URL `/`. The load balancer listens on port 80.
* [06-create-s3](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/06-create-s3-with-sampletext) - Terraform Create S3: Example of how deploy the creation of a S3 bucket on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* [07-terraform-state](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/07-create-dynamodbtable) - Terraform State: Example of how to store the information about what infrastructure has been created on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* [08-file-layout-example](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/08-create-a-noSQLdatabase) - Terraform File Layout: Example that contains a File Layout example of a Terraform file on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* [09-module-example](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/09-create-a-MySQLDatabase) - Terraform Module: Example that contains a module example of a Terraform file on AWS (Amazon Web Services). It shows how to develop (not duplicating code) web server clusters in different environments using a module.
* [10-multi-repo-example](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/10-create-S3website-with-CloudFront) - Terraform Muti Repo: Example that contains a multi repo example of a Terraform file on AWS (Amazon Web Services). It shows how to develop (not duplicating code) web server clusters in different environments using a module in another repo in order to use different version of the module in the environments.
* [11-loops-example](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/11.1-create-a-load-balancer-with-defaultvpc) - Terraform Loops: Example that contains the loops example of a Terraform file on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* [12-if-statements-example](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/12-create-an-sns-alert) - Terraform If-Statements & If-Else-Statements: Example that contains an If-Statements and If-Else-Statements example of a Terraform file on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* [13-if-else-statements-example](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/13-create-sqs-queue-terraform) - Terraform Simple If-Else-Statement: Example that contains the simple If-Else-Statement example of a Terraform file on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
* [14-zero-downtime-deployment](AWS Cloud Fundamentals/14-create-cluster-fargate) - Terraform Zero-Downtime Deployment: Example that contains a zero-downtime deployment example of a Terraform file on AWS (Amazon Web Services).
